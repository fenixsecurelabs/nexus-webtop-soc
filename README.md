**Docker Image Building Workflow**

Registries:
1. Dockerhub (pyrrhus/soc-admin-webtop)
2. Azure Container Registry
3. GitLab Container Registry (coming soon)
4. GitHub Container Registry (coming soon)

**Experimental**

Currently, SOC (Security-Operation-Center) is built using `linuxserver/webtop` and its desktop environment is `XFCE`. At the time when I was building the Dockerfile, I was testing different desktop environment, and for my own personal reason, I am using `XFCE`. However, the default build will be added soon.

This image comes preinstalled with `GitKraken` and `Suricata`. This is an optional SOC environment that can be expanded with whatever tools you want to add.

Future plans is to build two separate platforms `linux/amd64` and `linux-arm64`.

At this time, the container are signed with Azure KMS key. Before I was testing different keys, but for the moment, I am using multiple keys to see how easy it is to use.
